# Extreme Ownership

By Jocko William and Leif Babin

## Laws of Combat

1. Cover and Move

2. Simple

3. Prioritize and Execute

4. Decentralized Command

## No leadership without a team

"But without a team—a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission—there can be no leadership"

## No one else to blame

"Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame."

## Take ownership of what goes wrong

"I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong. That is what a leader does—even if it means getting fired."

## You can’t *make *people do things

"I explained that the direct responsibility of a leader included getting people to listen, support, and execute plans...But to implement real change, to drive people to accomplish something truly complex or difficult or dangerous—you can’t make people do those things. You have to lead them."

## There are no bad teams, only bad leaders

"leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance"

## Leader as forcing function

"Teams need a forcing function to get the different members working together to accomplish the mission and that is what leadership is all about."

## Believing in the mission

"They did have to understand why they were doing it so that they could believe in the mission."

"The most important question had been answered: Why?...If I didn’t believe in it, there was no way I could possibly convince the SEALs in my task unit to believe in it."

"In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission."

"Far more important than training or equipment, a resolute belief in the mission is critical for any team or organization to win and achieve big results."

## Know how the mission fits into strategic goals

"Every leader must be able to detach from th immediate tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals."

## Ask the questions to understand the decisions made

"If you don’t understand or believe in the decisions coming down from your leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why those decisions are being made."

## More than one leader

"Leadership isn’t one person leading a team. It is a group of leaders working together, up and down the chain of command, to lead."

## Ego clouds and disrupts everything

"Many of the disruptive issues that arise within any team can be attributed directly to a problem with ego."

## Up to you to explain

"It is up to you to explain the bigger picture to him—and to all your front line leaders. That is a critical component of leadership."

## Don’t forget about the other teams 

"I had become so immersed in the details, decision points, and immediate challenges of my own team that I had forgotten about the other team, what they could do for us and how we might help them."

## Keep it simple

"Simple, clear, concise information—exactly what was needed"

"Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success"

"And when things go wrong, and they inevitably do go wrong, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into total disaster. Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise."

## Prioritize and Execute

"Even the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed if they try to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously. The team will likely fail at each of those tasks."

## Don’t ask what to do, do it

"In such situations, the leaders did not call me and ask me what they should do. Instead, they told me what they were going to do."

"Junior leaders must be proactive rather than reactive."

## Understand the why

"Every tactical-level team leader must understand not just what to do but why they are doing it."

## Value of planning ahead

"That was what the mission planning was all about: never taking anything for granted, preparing for likely contingencies, and maximizing the chance of mission success while minimizing the risk to the troops executing the operation."

## Having a standardized plan

"For any team in any business or industry, it is essential to develop a standardized planning process."

## For team participation

"Team participation—even from the most junior personnel—is critical in developing bold, innovative solutions to problem sets."

## Leader’s checklist for planning

* Analyze the mission

* Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available

* Decentralize the planning process

* Determine a specific course of action

* Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action

* Plan for likely contingencies through each phrase of the operation

* Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible

* Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders

* Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation

* Brief the plan to all participants and support assets

* Conduct post-operational debrief after execution

## Danger of getting into the weeds as a leader

"If you are down in the weeds planning the details with your guys...you will have the same perspective as them, which adds little value. But if you let them plan the details, it allows them to own their piece of the plan. And it allows you to stand back and see everything with a different perspective."

## Connecting the dots for your troops

"Even when a leader thinks his troops understand the bigger picture, they very often have difficulty connecting the dots between the tactical mission they are immersed in with the greater overarching goal."

## Leading down the chain of command

"Any good leader is immersed in the planning and execution of tasks, projects, and operations to move the team toward a strategic goal."

"Leaders must routinely communicate with their team members to help them understand their role in the overall mission."

"If your team isn’t doing what they need to do, look at yourself."

## Be proactive, not reactive

"As a leader, my default setting should be aggressive—proactive rather than reactive...Instead of letting the situation dictate our decisions, we must dictate the situation."

## First test of the day

"The moment the alarm goes off is the first test; it sets the tone for the rest of the day."

## Making time

"The only way you could make time, was to get up early."

## Discipline gives you freedom

"Instead of making us more rigid and unable to improvise, this discipline actually made us more flexible, more adaptable, and more efficient. It allowed us to be creative."

## Dichotomy of Leadership

A good leader must be:

* Confident but not cocky

* Courageous but not foolhardy

* Competitive but a gracious loser

* Attentive to details but not obsessed by them

* Strong but have endurance

* A leader and follower

* Humble not passive

* Aggressive not overbearing

* Quiet not silent

* Calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions

* Close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge

* Able to execute extreme ownership, while exercising decentralized command

## Your biggest strength could be your greatest weakness

"As with many of the dichotomies of leadership, a person’s biggest strength can be his greatest weakness when he doesn’t know how to balance it."
