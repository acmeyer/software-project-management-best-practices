## On Managing People

* Don’t manage people as if they were machines or components of a system

* Projects don’t fail because of technology issues, they fail because of people issues (aka politics). The major problems are not technological in nature but sociological.

* Successes come from positive human interactions between project members.

* Cultivate the uniqueness amongst team members, uniqueness is not to be discouraged but rather encouraged.

* Pay more attention to how people fit into the project as a whole and less to some individual characteristic like lines of code they’ve written.

* Teams need a catalyst, someone who can help the team jell, they’re worth more than just people who do the work.

* Give people time to do other things besides just a task. They need time to brainstorm, try new methods, avoid unnecessary work, read, train, and have fun

* The more challenging the task at hand, the more time to do things other than the task is important.

* Turnover matters in productivity. If lots of people are leaving, productivity is greatly reduced.

* Emotions will come into play in a project. Emotions in the workplace usually arise from threatened self-esteem, which is typically tied to the quality of the product made.

* Forget about Parkinson’s Law. That applies to bureaucracies. The people who work with you care about the product they produce and therefore Parkinson’s Law doesn’t apply to them. Treating them as if it did will only de-motivate them.

    * A variation instead that may apply is: Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day.

* In a healthy work environment, people don’t perform because they:

    * Lack competence

    * Lack confidence

    * Lack affiliation with others on the project and the project’s goals

* If a worker is unable to perform, it is a sign he or she is overwhelmed by the work and that they need to be reassigned, possibly to a different company.

* If a people needs encouragement to get their work done, the manager should be the very last resource. It works far better when the message comes from the team.

* The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

* **The Hawthorne Effect**: Loosely stated, it says that people perform better when they’re trying something new.

* Sociology matters more than technology or even money.

## On Errors and Failure

* Making mistakes is natural and a healthy part of doing work, create an atmosphere that accepts errors and failures so that people are willing to take risks and try things

* Actively encourage people to make some errors. Let them know that having not made any errors is not the right answer

## On Quality

* People care about the quality of the product they produce.

* Setting unreachable deadlines can jeopardize the quality of a product and therefore cause your team to be discouraged and unmotivated by the work.

* Quality is a means to higher productivity. When people are proud of the work they produce, they will be more productive.

* Consider giving the project team the power of veto. The team can decide whether or not to ship a product based on their own standards, not necessarily the standards of the end user.

## On Estimates

* Programmers are more productive when they do the estimation themselves, rather than a manager doing it for them.

* If workers feel the schedule is unreasonable and unrealistic they don’t work very effectively.

* Projects where the boss applied no schedule pressure had the highest productivity.

## On The Office Environment

* An unproductive environment is apparent when people come in early, stay late, or stay home in order to get a critical piece of work done.

* Productive space is quieter, more private, better protected from interruption, and there’s more of it. Studies have shown this is the case.

* When thinking about costs, evaluate how much productivity and effectiveness is wasted in a cheap open-office plan. The amount of productivity lost may be more than it would cost to make the office more conducive to productive work.

* Collect data in order to measure effectiveness of the workplace but let people know that the data collected will not be used against them, otherwise people will not be honest in self-assessment and the data will be inaccurate and lead to the wrong incites.

* Thinking based jobs, like most jobs today, require entering a period of flow state. This typically requires 15 minutes or so of concentration before it can even begin. That means each interruption, requires an additional immersion period to get back into flow.

* Aim to give people at least a few hours a day for uninterrupted time. You should do all you can to protect this time for your team. Keep a measurement of the amount of time like this your team gets and aim to increase it as much as possible.

    * Measurement called **E-Factor** = Uninterrupted Hours / Body-Present Hours

    * Emphasize the E-Factor of your team

* Interruption applies to communication too. Phone calls are worst, then instant messaging systems like Slack, then email. It is in the expectations, change the expectations for how responsive one needs to be in communication amongst your team.

* The quality of people’s time is important, not just its quantity.

* Just because a person’s workplace might be messy, does not mean they don’t care about the attributes of the workplace.

* Appearance doesn’t matter so much in workplace design. What matters is whether the workplace lets you work or inhibits you. Work-conducive office space is not a status symbol, it’s a necessity. Either you pay for it by shelling out what it costs, or you pay for it in lost productivity.

* The best workplace is not going to be perfectly replicable. What works for one may not work for another. The best workplaces have lots of different setups, it’s more organic.

* **The ideal workplace:** A good workplace strikes the balance between too enclosed and too exposed. There shouldn’t be a wall directly in front of you so that you can occasionally look up and focus on something in the distance (to give your eyes a break). You should not be able to hear noises much different than the ones you make from where you work. People can concentrate on a task better if they work around others doing the same thing.

* Each team needs identifiable public and semi-private space. Each individual needs protected private space.

* Each team should be able to eat together. Make the common meal a regular event. It should become an important, comfortable, and daily event.

* If your team really needs to get work done, the best thing to do is to move them to a temporary ad hoc space, like an off-site spot at a hotel or house. This increases energy and they will suffer less from noise and interruption. It also helps them form a group identity.

## On Finding the Right People

* Aim to have the same people on a project at the beginning and the end. If someone isn’t right from the start, they will never be.

* Lead without positional authority by:

    * Step up to the task

    * Be evidently fit for the task

    * Prepare for the task by doing the required homework ahead of time

    * Maximize value to everyone

    * Do it all with humor and obvious goodwill

    * Charisma also helps

* Leadership is best when it arises naturally.

* Aptitude test are likely to give you people who perform well in the short term but not the long term. Rather than strictly hiring for the task at hand, hire for potential trajectory as well. Hire for the long term.

* Rather than aptitude test, let candidates do a presentation to their potential co-workers on some aspect of their past work. But make sure it is related to the actual work your organization does. That way you can really see their passion (or not) for the work they are about to do.

* Giving others who will be a candidates co-workers a say in choosing the candidate will help them integrate better if chosen. This doesn’t mean they have to make the final decision but they will better understand a decision if they are included in it.

* An organization with high turnover prevents people from taking the long view. Turnover begets more turnover. The loss of an employee is only the visible cost of turnover, the unseen things are how long it will take for their replacement to get up to speed and to integrate well with the existing team.

* The best organizations are always striving to be the best. Having a common goal provides direction, joint satisfaction, and belief amongst employees. People don’t want to leave the best organizations, you would be silly to do so. Being the best requires a long-term outlook since it is a long-term goal.

* Invest in your people. Pay for them to go to school, get training, and otherwise learning new skills. It will pay dividends to you later and they will feel more loyalty to the organization. You’ll also have much less turnover.

## On Teams

* The best work groups are where team interactions are everything. They are the reason people put all their effort into the work to overcome challenges.

* A good team has a feeling of joint ownership of the product they build. They take pride in their work.

* Once you’ve decided on the people for a task, go all in on them. Your best bet is to trust them. Let them make mistakes. If the team doesn’t feel like they can be trusted, then they won’t be able to bond together.

* There has to be a goal for the team. The team needs to believe in whatever goal it forms around. You need to provide the why, don’t just tell them it is important.

* Make sure people aren’t put onto too many teams at once. They’ll never be able to be part of a true jelled team if they are on too many teams.

* Teams are motivated by the idea that their work is important and that doing well is worthwhile.

* A sign of a good team is peer-coaching. Good teams understand that the success of the individual is tied to the success of the whole. Success breeds success.

* Good managers provide frequent easy opportunities for the team to succeed together. 

* The best success is the one where there is no evident management involved. The best boss is the one who can manage is to happen again and again. Where the team member don’t know they’ve been managed in any way.

* If you’ve got good people working for you, there’s probably nothing you can do to improve their chances of success more than just getting out of their way.

* Encourage and facilitate off-site working. Give them a chance to get away for a few days and work together in peace. This gives them even more of an opportunity to jell.

* Visual supervision is a joke for development workers. How can you tell people aren’t slacking off and not paying attention to their work? By looking at the product they produce.

* Give people the chance to work with others they want to work with. This is how the best teams form.

* The best bosses take chances. They take changes on their people.

* In organizations with the best chemistry, managers devote their energy to building and maintaining healthy chemistry.

* **Organization chemistry-building strategy**:

    * Make a cult of quality

    * Provide lots of satisfying closure

    * Build a sense of eliteness

    * Allow and encourage heterogeneity

    * Preserve and protect successful teams

    * Provide strategic but not tactical direction

* People need reassurance that they are head in the right direction. 

* Don’t discourage uniqueness, it’ll happen anyway. 

* Successful management is getting every to pull in the same direction and getting them fired up to the point that nothing, not even the manager, could stop their progress.

## On Meetings 

* The addition of technology in meetings is bad. They rarely help enhance the meetings and more often than not, provide an escape for people.

* **Working meetings:** meetings that have a group action that terminates the meeting. You should be able to answer the question: "What ends this meeting?"

* **Ceremonial meetings:** meetings that are ended by the clock.

* Aim for working meetings, not ceremonial meetings. 

* The only people who should be in working meetings are those that are needed to take the action. The fewer the people the better.

* The cost of a meeting is directly proportional to the number of people attending.

* Try to eliminate all ceremonial meetings and instead spend time in more one-on-one conversations.

* An alternative approach to ceremonial meetings is called Open-Space networking. This is unstructured interaction. There are no formal discussion but instead small interactions are encouraged instead.

* Reject your own need for the confirmation that comes from ceremonial meetings.

## On Managing Knowledge Workers

* The ultimate management sin is wasting  people’s time.

* A good coach understands that his or her job is not to coordinate interaction, but to help people learn to self-coordinate.

* Don’t divide up a knowledge worker’s time on many tasks. They won’t be able to get into flow states and they’ll never be able to join a jelled team.

## On Email

* Discourage spamming people by copying them onto emails or writing emails to lots of recipients.

* Allow people to **pull** information rather than have it **pushed** onto them.

* Each time you’re inclined to send a coordinating email to a colleague or to anyone who works for you, think about what steps you have to make to coach that person to self-coordinate.

## On Dealing with Change

* People hate change because the uncertainty is more compelling than the potential gain.

* In order to manage transitions well, don’t talk down about the old ways. Instead celebrate the old as a way to help change happen.

* Change won’t get started unless people feel safe. People need to know they won’t be demeaned or degraded for proposing a change or trying to get one through.

* Change only has a chance of succeeding if failure is also okay.

## On Organizational Learning

* Just because your organization gains experience does not mean it is learning.

* Experience that gets turned into learning when an organization changes itself to take into account what experience has shown.

* Learning is limited by an organization’s ability to keep its people. When turnover is high, learning is unlikely to stick or can’t take place at all.

* A lot of organizational learning happens at the middle manager level. Successful learning organizations have strong middle management. Middle managers must communicate with each other to work together in effective harmony.

## On Creating Community

* What great managers do best: make a community. People are built to need a community.

* A community doesn’t just happen, it has to be made.

* An organization that succeeds in building a satisfying community tends to keep its people.

## On Making a Fun Place to Work

* A little bit of disorder and chaos can have a positive effect.

* Some ways to introduce small amounts of disorder to your team:

    * Pilot projects

    * War games/Hackathons

    * Brainstorming

    * Provocative training experiences

    * Training, trips, conferences, celebrations, and retreats

* Running hackathons into the wee hours of the night adds to the fun. It gives people the chance to see other members of the team as they might not otherwise. They form a closer bond as a result.

* Unexpected lunches can be a treat to team members, especially ones that go outside the box.

* Be able to identify the few key spirits who have the proper mix of perspective and maturity. Then turn them loose. Don’t give them direction but rather get out of their way.
