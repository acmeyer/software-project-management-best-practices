# The Mythical Man-Month Book Notes

## The problem with adding more people to a project
* More programming projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
* Programming software is pure thought-stuff. Since our ideas are faulty, we have bugs.
* Dividing a project or task up amongst multiple people creates the need for additional communication (training, internal communication, etc.). Additional communication increases the amount of time and effort required to complete a task or project.
* The lack of certainty in our scheduling estimates creates a lack of courage to defend them stubbornly against management and customer pressure. This could lead to even more unrealistic timelines, which leads to disappointment.
* *Brooks’ Law*: adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
Adding people to a software project increases the total effort necessary in three ways: the work and disruption of dividing up the work itself, training the new people, and added communication requirements.

## The Idea of the Surgical Team
* The best programmers are 10x better than bad ones.
* The small sharp team is the best approach to getting projects done well and in a timely manner — as few minds as possible. The best form is two people, with one being the leader. But these teams should never exceed 10 people.
* Teams should be organized like surgical teams: instead of everyone doing the cutting, one person does the cutting and they are surrounded by a team that helps him or her be as productivity and effective as possible.
* It’s important that there is as much transparency in the process as possible so that all team members can see what’s going on and the steps taken to bring the project to its completion.

## The Importance of Communication and Organization
* Disasters arise from a lack of communication, when teams don’t stay on the same page and teams drift apart in their assumptions.
* Teams should communicate with one another in as many ways as possible: informally, regular project meetings, and through documentation (emails, electronic documents, messaging, etc.).
* Teams should keep a *Project Workbook*. The Project Workbook should consist of all the documents for a particular project. This workbook should be visible to all team members at all times. It should be updated continuously throughout the project in a timely manner. Changes should be visible and clearly marked so that everyone can see the changes that were made over time, they should be kept in a change summary.
* The purpose of organization is to reduce the amount of communication and coordination necessary. Organization embodies division of labor and specialization of function in order to obviate communication.
* The communication structure in an organization is a network, not a tree.
* Every subproject has two leadership roles to be filled, that of the producer and that of the technical director, or architect. They are distinct roles and require different talents.

## Importance of Documentation
* A small number of documents are the critical pivots around which every project’s management revolves.
* For a software project, the critical documents are the objectives, user manual, internals documentation, schedule, budget, organization chart, and floor space allocation.
* Even on small projects, these documents should be created from the beginning.
* Preparing each document focuses thought and crystallizes discussion. The act of writing requires hundreds of mini-decisions, and it is the existence of these that distinguish clear, exact policies from fuzzy ones.
* Maintaining each critical document provides a status surveillance and warning mechanism. Each document serves as a checklist and a database.
* The project manager’s fundamental job is to keep everybody going in the same direction. Their chief daily task is communication, not decision-making. The documents communicate the plans and decisions to the whole team.
* The tool that saves the most labor in a programming project is probably a text-editing system.
* Before any code is written, the specification should be handed to outside groups for feedback on completeness and clarity. This can be done with internal teams outside of the engineering/product team.
* The user manual documentation is as important as the user interface.
* Even for the most private of programs, prose documentation is necessary, for memory will fail the creator.
* Most documentation fails in giving to little overview. Stand way back and zoom in slowly.
* The critical user documentation should be drafted before the program is built, for it embodies basic planning decisions.
* Documentation of program internals, for anyone who may modify it, also demands a prose overview.
* The flowchart is an overrated piece of documentation. Few programs need more than a one-page flowchart, if that.
* For documentation to be used by programmers that may modify the program, tell why things are the way they are, rather than merely how they are. Purpose is the key to understanding.

## Keeping Projects On-Time
* “How does a project get to be a year late?...One day at a time.”
* Day-by-day schedule slippage is harder to recognize, harder to prevent, and harder to make up than disasters.
* The first step in controlling a big project on a tight schedule is to have a schedule, made up of milestones and dates for them.
* Milestones should be concrete, specific, measurable events clearly defined.
* Chronic schedule slippage is a morale-killer.
* The preparation of a critical-path chart is the most valuable part of its use, since laying out the network, identifying the dependencies, and estimating the segments force a great deal of very specific planning very early in a project.
* Managers should encourage honest stats reporting by avoiding using them against the reporter or using them to create panic or judgement.
* There should be review techniques for status reports so that all members of the team are aware of the current status. Milestone schedules and completion documents are key.
