# Software Project Management Best Practices

There are a lot of resources and tools out there for the coding side of software development but not a lot on another important aspect of software development: project management. This repository serves to try and address that shortcoming. Resources that can be found in this repository will include book notes, document templates, helpful links, and more.

The intention is to update this repository continously as I come across new methods and ideas from my own experiences or those of others. Any improvements, additions, and changes are welcome, just submit a pull-request!
